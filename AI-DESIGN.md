# AI Design & Explainability

## Model Approach
- Unsupervised topic clustering
- AI-generated summaries per cluster
- Trend detection across time windows

## Why This Approach
- Avoids training bias
- Easier to explain to stakeholders
- Faster iteration

## Explainability
- Sample feedback shown per cluster
- Confidence score for summaries
- Manual override for PMs

## Human-in-the-Loop
PMs validate clusters and decide actions.
AI assists but does not automate decisions.
